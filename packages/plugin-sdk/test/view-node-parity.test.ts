/**
 * The view-node vocabulary is defined TWICE — `leafOptions` in
 * `packages/plugin-sdk/src/pages.ts` and `leafOptions` in
 * `packages/shared/src/dto/plugins.ts` — and the two must agree. The SDK's copy
 * validates a node at AUTHORING time, when `definePlugin` checks a manifest;
 * shared's copy validates it on the WIRE, when the browser runs
 * `PluginsPayloadSchema.parse` over the whole plugin payload.
 *
 * Skew between them is not "an older package lacks a feature". It is two
 * validators disagreeing about what is valid, and it fails at a distance: the
 * hub accepts the node, the browser rejects it, and because that parse is
 * all-or-nothing one bad leaf takes down the entire payload — nav included, not
 * just the page that used it.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. The `cards` leaf shipped in the SDK and never
 * reached shared, and nothing caught it until a human tried to render a hand
 * (`@gl3/shared@0.1.6` carries the fix). Shared's own comment concedes the
 * coupling — "Kept identical to the SDK's copy" — which is a comment doing a
 * test's job. This is the test.
 *
 * Neither `leafOptions` array is exported, so rather than restating the
 * vocabulary here — which would just add a THIRD hand-maintained copy of the
 * thing under test — both sets are read back out of the schemas themselves: a
 * `discriminatedUnion` handed an unknown discriminator reports every value it
 * would have accepted.
