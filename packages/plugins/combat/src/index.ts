/**
 * Who the caller could shoot, here, right now.

 * Read-only: no locks, no cooldown consumed. That last part is the point of
 * the route. `attack` claims its Redis cooldown BEFORE the transaction and
 * deliberately never releases it on a 4xx, so firing at an illegal target
 * costs the attacker a full cooldown. A pre-evaluated list is what stops the
 * UI from spending a player's cooldown to discover a rule.
 *
 * ADVISORY ONLY. `attack` re-checks every rule under the lock; nothing here is
 * trusted. `target_elsewhere` has no `reason` because such a player is simply
 * absent from the list.
 *
 * Does NOT evaluate the CALLER's own `hospitalUntil`/`jailedUntil` — only
 * each row's. `attack` checks the attacker's own sentence first (423,
 * before ever looking at the target: lines 147-152 above) and this route has
 * no reason member for that in the brief's `TargetReason` enum, so a
 * hospitalised or jailed caller (this route sets neither `accessInJail` nor
 * `accessInHospital`, so both default to open — see `logRoute`'s comment)
 * sees ordinary rows here that `attack` would still 423 on their own status
 * alone. That gap does not cost a cooldown either way — the loader gate and
 * `attack`'s own re-check both run before the Redis claim — so the advisory
 * purpose (never spend a cooldown to learn a rule) still holds; it is only
 * this route's per-target `hospitalised`/`jailed` reasons that reuse those
 * names for the TARGET's sentence, matching `attack`'s `target_hospitalised`/
 * `target_jailed` 409s, not its own-status 423s.
 *
 * Bounded at 50 and NOT paginated — the same deliberate limitation
 * GET /api/combat/log has, recorded here rather than discovered later.
