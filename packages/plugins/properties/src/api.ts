/**
 * Credit (`amount > 0`) or debit (`amount < 0`) the property's owner and move
 * `profit` by the amount actually CREDITED. Credits are first reduced by the
 * franchise skim (`properties.skim_percent`, default 10%, read live from the
 * settings table — 0 restores full payout): the skimmed share is destroyed by
 * never being credited, since the consumer already debited the payer in full.
 * Returns the amount that actually moved — a debit is clamped to the owner's
 * cash and never skimmed, so `profit` never claims a loss the ledger did not
 * take and a house that pays out pays in full. Returns 0n when the property
 * is unowned or `amount` is 0n.
 *
 * V2's `Property::updateProfit()` plus the balance write its callers do by
 * hand; folded together here so a consumer cannot move one without the other.
 *
 * SILENT SHORT-PAY. The clamp is silent: nothing throws, `sum(ledger) ==
 * balance` still holds, and a caller that ignores the return value (as
 * `bullets` does — its one call site, `bullets/src/index.ts:175`, only ever
 * credits, so it never hits this branch) gets no signal that the owner could
 * not cover the debit. Any consumer whose payout can exceed its intake in a
 * single interaction MUST check affordability before committing to it, not
 * discover the shortfall here — e.g. an up-front exposure check refusing the
 * interaction when `stake × maxPayoutMultiplier > ownerCash`, re-checked on
 * anything that can raise the stake mid-interaction. `bullets` needs no such
 * guard: a sale can never pay out more than it takes in.
 *
 * THE 0n RETURN IS THREE-WAY AMBIGUOUS. It means "unowned", "`amount` was
 * 0n", and "the owner changed between the unlocked pre-read and the locked
 * re-read, so this call skipped the payout" (see TOCTOU below) — a caller
 * cannot tell these apart from the return value alone. The third case is
 * usually a same-property transfer racing this call, but `seizeOnKill` (see
 * `ownerAt`'s doc comment above) can also cause it outside any transfer.
 *
 * LOCK ORDER (rule 6). This is order-CONFORMING on its own, not merely
 * order-dependent on the caller: an unlocked pre-read of `owner_player_id`
 * (the same idiom `ownerAt` uses), then `tx.locks.player([ownerId])`, and
 * only then the `FOR UPDATE` re-read that decides who actually gets paid. A
 * caller that touches no other player may call this holding nothing.
 *
 * MUST: a consumer that also acts on a DIFFERENT player in the same
 * transaction (the buyer) MUST resolve the owner (via `ownerAt`) and take
 * both through ONE sorted `tx.locks.player([buyer, ownerId])` call BEFORE
 * calling this or moving any balance. Re-locking an already-held row within
 * one transaction is a no-op re-acquisition, never a wait, so that pre-lock
 * does not conflict with the lock this function takes on its own — but
 * locking the buyer alone and letting THIS function lock the owner
 * afterwards, in its own separate statement, is exactly the ABBA shape that
 * deadlocks against the reverse purchase (owner buying from buyer's own
 * shop at the same moment).
 * Regression: `apps/server/test/properties-consumer-lock-order.test.ts`.
 *
 * TOCTOU. If ownership changes between the unlocked pre-read and the locked
 * re-read (a transfer lands in that gap), the row this function locked is
 * the PRE-read owner's, not the new one's — paying the new owner would move
 * money for a player whose row this call never locked, reopening the exact
 * hole this function exists to close. So it skips the payout instead:
 * `moved` is 0n for this call. The next call against the same property (the
 * new owner's next sale) reads the correct owner and pays them.
