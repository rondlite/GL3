/**
 * The explicit id→manifest map for OPTIONAL plugins (spec: Boot sequence
 * step 1). A static `import` is what keeps the dependency direction
 * checkable by the compiler — the example package imports only
 * `@gl3/plugin-sdk`/`zod`/`drizzle-orm`, and a dynamic `import(pluginId)`
 * would bypass that check. Framework plugins (ranks, bank, mail, ...) are
 * not looked up here — they load in every profile through `bundledPlugins`.
 * The gameplay plugins ARE here as well as in `GAMEPLAY_PLUGINS`: the full
 * profile loads them automatically, and under `GL3_PROFILE=framework`
 * `PLUGIN_IDS` is the only way they load.
 *
 * Those static imports are now GENERATED rather than hand-written:
 * `installed-plugins.ts` is produced by `npm run plugins:generate` from
 * apps/server's direct dependencies that declare `"gl3": { "plugin": true }`.
 * Installing a marketplace plugin is therefore a dependency plus a regenerate
 * — never an edit to this file, which is what stops every operator from
 * forking core. The compiler check survives because the generated imports are
 * still static; only the authorship changed.

 * load twice. It is wrong here: an operator who installs `@acme/casino` and gets
 * nothing has no way to discover that its id collided with ours, because the
 * plugin simply never appears. Two packages colliding with each other is
