/**
 * Deadline arithmetic for the live countdowns (crime cooldown, jail sentence).
 *
 * The first version of this counted `setInterval(1000)` ticks and subtracted
 * one per tick. Two things make that wrong in a real browser: background tabs
 * throttle timers to as little as one tick per minute, and a suspended laptop
 * stops them altogether. The displayed number then drifts slow and never
 * recovers — a jail sentence that expired minutes ago still reads "1:58".
 *
 * So a timer is stored as an *absolute deadline* and the remaining seconds are
 * derived from `Date.now()` on every render. Skipped ticks then cost nothing:
 * the next render is correct regardless of how many were missed. The interval
 * that drives re-rendering becomes a repaint trigger, not the source of truth.
 *
 * The state is a plain `Record<id, epochMs>`; the reducers below return the
 * *same object* when nothing changed so React can bail out of the re-render.

 * restarted a 30s cooldown at its full length every time the player changed
 * page and came back — the server kept the real deadline, so it was visual

 * down). Anchoring at the reading's own timestamp makes a stale snapshot and a
